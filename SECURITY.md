# General Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within code I created, please send me an email via caen@desilva.se.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

> Please note that the project in question may have its own security policy that should be followed instead.

### Secure Messaging

If your query contains sensitive information, you can contact me through my secure email caendesilva@proton.me.
You can encrypt the message with my ECC (Curve25519) PGP public key #1e5927e9911dd85104e16cb87e3297d760686779
which is stored in the [public-key.txt](public-key.txt) file.
